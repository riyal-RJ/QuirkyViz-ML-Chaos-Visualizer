Tech Stack: streamlit and all model libraries

Developed a Streamlit web app for visualizing decision boundaries of various machine learning models. 
Users can upload datasets, select features, choose classification algorithms, and visualize results with interactive plots.One can also tune the hyper-parameters. The app supports multiple classifiers and provides detailed performance metrics, enhancing user understanding and decision-making in ML projects..

## The Outlook of the WEb App
